  Hey everyone!

  My grandson, Alex Robinson, asked me to write a small text for you all since you seem to enjoy our challenges. Did you know that Alex was born in the 2000s? He is still young but has already found a job. He is currently living in Anderlecht, which is quite annoying for me as it is far from my place. He doesn't come to visit me at home that often, but I'm okay with that as I have "Blopblop", my goldfish. Additionally, I sometimes go see Alex at his badminton club where his friends like to call him "Robyeye" because he always say yes for a game of badminton.

  I hope you learned a bit more about me!

  Regards,
  Grandpa Hubert

name: "Grandma Mireille's final vault"
author: "Sander Van Dessel"
category: Cryptography
description: |-
  Grandma Mireille loves to read books, not a month goes by when she does not have a new pile of books laying somewhere in her loving room.
  While most of them are non-fiction, she sometimes is open to read fiction as well.
  One of these rare occasions involved the works of Tolkien. She mainly started to read them because she is also very interested in languages (She often joined "Het Groot Dictee der Nederlandse Taal" and often had almost no mistakes),
  and Tolkien is of course also a well known linguist who created multiple languages for his novels.
  When I was recently searching for a clue of her second vault, I found some notes written in a strange language, accompanied by 20 beatifull rings.
  Might these contain a hint to open her second vault ?

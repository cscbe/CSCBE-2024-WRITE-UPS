category: Cryptography
description: |-
  My grandma was always a fan of using paper instead of storing items on a harddrive. Paper is of course a very secure method to store your secrets and private keys, but it also has it downsides.
  One of those downsides lies in the fact that she forgot to laminate the paper, which created a bit of a problem when she spilled coffee all over her pile of secret keys.
  She thought that she ruined all of the paper and that she never would be able to retrieve the secrets she noted down in her encrypted file, but I know it is still technically possible by using some clever tricks.
  Can you help her retrieve her private key and decrypt her files ?

## Category
Cryptography

## Estimated difficulty
Easy

## Description
Flag is encrypted using two byte XOR, easy to bruteforce

## Scenario
  Do you really want to eat that?
  It doesn't look like a hash brown to me.

## Write-up
The given file is a pure binary with no specific indication.
We're told that the file doesn't look like a hash, and, indeed, it doesn't fit most hash algorithms.
We can keep looking in that direction, closest to hashes still in cryptography is encryption.
Giving this to any XOR solver (such as Cyber Chef's) with a key length of 2, and a known plaintext of CSC, the flag appears.

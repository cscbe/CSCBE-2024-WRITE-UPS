name: "Grandma Mireille's third vault"
author: "Sander Van Dessel"
category: Cryptography
description: |-
  Besides reading books, she also loved to look at the weather.
  She even kept records of weather in Brussels since 1945 !
  But, when I was looking at the data she noted down from 1970, there seemd to be some strange differences between her version and the official records.
  Could this be another clue to find the rumoured grandparents' vault ?

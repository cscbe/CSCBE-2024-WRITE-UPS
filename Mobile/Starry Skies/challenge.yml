description: |-
  We've barely caught the technomancer, and he's already escaped!
  We're already planning on raiding his Observatory again, but we need a flag to get in.

  It seems that he's doubled down on his app's security, but he seemingly ignored performance in the meantime, what a stuttery mess!
  We've done all of our negociation techniques, but the program refuses to cooperate once again!
  Can you pick the pocket of this evil program, and give us the key to the technomancer's Observatory?

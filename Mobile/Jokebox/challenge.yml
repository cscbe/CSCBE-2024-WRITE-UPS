  I encountered a random eccentric guy who shared an unusual mobile application with me. (Who actually does that, seriously ?!)
  At first glance it appears to be a simple soundboard, but the guy insisted that a hidden secret lies within.
  He also told me to keep the sound turned on while I'm using the app, but I'm not sure if it's very helpful, this guy was very weird...
  Could you please retrieve the secret ?

Humpty Dumpty built an tunnel so fine, securing his connections, line by line. 
But with one mistake, he took a great fall, And **<ip goes here>** couldn't protect him at all.
All the king's cryptographers and all the king's geeks, Tried to find the lost secret, despite the leaks. 
But with thisistheflagdotbe denied and data adrift, Poor Humpty remained in a security rift.

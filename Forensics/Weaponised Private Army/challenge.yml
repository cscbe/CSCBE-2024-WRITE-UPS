  Mr Prime Minister!
  We've intercepted the communications of a dangerous PMC owner, one of our agents was on his flight, and he appeared to access secret plans for his "Inner Hell" offshore military base.
  Everyone here at the agency has tried to decrypt what our agent recovered, but none have managed to recover the secret plans...

  We've heard you have 1337 H4XX0R 5K1LL5, you have to help us, like a true Patriot!

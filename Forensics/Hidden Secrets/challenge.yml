description: |-
  In the last week we have been analyzing all data that was collected from the workstation of a suspicious individual in the context of an investigation we are assisting on.
  We are still looking for some sensitive data that might be crucial for the investigation.
  Unfortunately, our forensic experts are not available at the moment and we need to know more about a suspicious zip file.
  The zip file is encrypted, but we already managed to crack it by blasting rockyou on it.
  However, we are none the wiser and really need results, the sooner the better.
  Can you assist and have a look?
  
  The password is 'hiddensecrets'.

name: "Shapeshifter 2"
author: "Alex Van Mechelen"
category: Reversing
description: |-
  The first shapeshifter binary soon learned it was too easy for reversers like you to figure out its original message.
  That's why it evolved and protected itself even more, to prevent anyone from finding the flag after its first execution.
  I really needed that flag, so I quickly executed the binary while it was still possible. ...but now the flag is gone.
  Legend says only 1337 reversers can figure out what the binary used to print.

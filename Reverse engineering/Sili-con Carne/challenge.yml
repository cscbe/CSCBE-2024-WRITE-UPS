  We found a delapidated laboratory under a decrepit restaurant kitchen, apparently formerly squatted by a long time POI.
  It's got it all: rusty disks, destroyed computers, and contraband microcontrollers being manufactured.
  We've been hoping to find this guy's password for ever, but he's always used his own designs to keep us off his chips.
  And old laptop was amongst the rubble, but we only managed to extract a few files before it burst in flames, a bunch of source files, binaries, and one note.
  Can you somehow find his password amongst all of this?

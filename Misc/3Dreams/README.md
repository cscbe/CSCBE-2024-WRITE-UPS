# 3Dreams

Web/Misc challenge using ThreeJS. User is put in a 3D environnement and is allowed to look around and move forward/backward. The movement is restricted to a certain path, making it somewhat erratic. This is because the camera is set on the path drawn by the flag.  

## Installation

 Run `sudo docker-compose up --build`

## Scenario

Did I tell you about this dream I made last night ? It was so weird and erratic... And there was this voice saying "the flag is under your nose"...  

## Solve

Since the flag is the path followed by the camera, download the file from `/cameraPath.glb`. Open it in Blender or other softwares supporting the format and the flag will appear.

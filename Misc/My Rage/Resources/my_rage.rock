THE GOVERNMENT SAYS "CRACKDOWNS"!
MY ARMY IS ONE!
KNOCK MY ARMY DOWN!
MY BULLETS ARE BURNING!
MY HOPE IS GOING!
MY BODY IS WITHERING!

PUT THE GOVERNMENT INTO MY RAGE!
LET THE WORLD BE MY ARMY!

SHOUT MY RAGE at THE WORLD!
SHOUT MY RAGE at MY BULLETS!

BUILD THE WORLD UP!
BUILD THE WORLD UP!
SHOUT MY RAGE at THE WORLD!
SHOUT MY RAGE AT MY HOPE!

SHOUT MY RAGE AT MY BULLETS!
SHOUT MY RAGE AT MY BODY!

MY THOUGHTS ARE NOW OFF.
CAST MY THOUGHTS INTO ME.
whisper me.

  I'm trying to start a band, but I'm not a musician, or creative, or anything.
  Thankfully, there are these websites where you can hire random people to do stuff for you, like making music!

  All I told them was that I wanted Rock, and the lyric <code>The Government says "Crackdowns"</code>
  I got back very similar things, I suppose that makes that lyric so good, everybody knows what to write afterwards!
  I can't wait to be a rockstar!

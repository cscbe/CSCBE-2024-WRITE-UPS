## Category

## Estimated difficulty
Easy

## Description
Rockstar code sung by AI

## Scenario
  I'm trying to start a band, but I'm not a musician, or creative, or anything.
  Thankfully, there are these websites where you can hire random people to do stuff for you, like making music!

  All I told them was that I wanted Rock, and the lyric <code>The Government says "Crackdowns"</code>
  I got back very similar things, I suppose that makes that lyric so good, everybody knows what to write afterwards!
  I can't wait to be a rockstar!

## Write-up
The music we receive is rock, the challenge also mentions "rockstar".

Rockstar is an esoteric language made to vaguely look like song lyrics, all we have to do is to listen to the music given, and write the lyrics down, starting with the one given in the challenge.

```
The Government says "Crackdowns"
my army is one
knock my army down
my bullets are burning
my hope is going
my body is withering

put the government into my rage
let the world be my army
shout my rage at the world
shout my rage at my bullets

build the world up
build the world up
shout my rage at the world
shout my rage at my hope
shout my rage at my bullets
shout my rage at my body

my thoughts are now off
cast my thoughts into me
whisper me
```

Running it, we get the flag, `rockon!`

(Note: you need the quotes around crackdowns, I thought they were ignored by the language, but they're not.)
(I could have remade the challenge, but I ran out of credits on the platform I used to generate the AI music.)

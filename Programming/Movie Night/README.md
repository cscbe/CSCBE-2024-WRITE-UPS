## Creator bio
Penetration tester at NTT, I always loved breaking stuff and now I get to do it for a living. The CSCBE was one of the reason I started playing CTFs, focused my attention to offensive security and found my passion. I am now returning the favor with some challenges, hoping you all have fun, and some headaches too.

# QR Frenzy

## Category
Programming

## Estimated difficulty
Medium

## Description
The user is provided with a base64 encoded image that contains multiple qr codes, each with a number in the middle. The goal is to get the key by concatenating every qr code content in the right order, based on the numbers in the codes. When the correct key is sent to the server, the flag is given. For increased difficulty, both the numbers and qr codes are randomly rotated and placed randomly in the image.

## Scenario
Navigate the virtual labyrinth of a rogue AI's encryption by assembling scattered QR codes. Crack the code to neutralize the digital threat and restore order to the digital realm.

## Creator bio
Penetration tester at NTT, I always loved breaking stuff and now I get to do it for a living. The CSCBE was one of the reason I started playing CTFs, focused my attention to offensive security and found my passion. I am now returning the favor with some challenges, hoping you all have fun, and some headaches too.

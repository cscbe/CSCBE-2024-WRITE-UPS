## Description
The player is given a puzzle to solve. The puzzle is composed of a grid of shuffled numbers, which the players must put back in the correct order. To do so, the player can move a cursor in every direction, which he can also use as a buffer to store one number at a time. In order to retreive the flag, the player must submit the list of moves as a string. For instance: urlbddb -> Up Right Left Buffer Down Down Buffer

## Scenario
My niece asked me some help with her puzzle, but I am not sure how to solve it. I spent a lot of time on it, but I don't think I will be able to help my niece. I left you with the instructions and the puzzle, please help her.

## Creator bio
Penetration tester at NTT, I always loved breaking stuff and now I get to do it for a living. The CSCBE was one of the reason I started playing CTFs, focused my attention to offensive security and found my passion. I am now returning the favor with some challenges, hoping you all have fun, and some headaches too.
